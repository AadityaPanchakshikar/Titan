# Titan
I am uploading this project now but this is a very old project I had made to learn about the single board computer (SBC) raspberry pi. I was probably in 6th grade at the time I was making it. the goal was to understand ssh basic linux commands, using raspberry pi headlessly aslo how to use a driver for the motor control using gpio pins

I choose the name Titan because it was rumored that Apple was working on a secrete Apple Car under the 
name: project Titan.
